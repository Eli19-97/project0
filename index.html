        <h1>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Elo Ratings</h1>
        <h3>What is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu?</h3>
        <p>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a grappling-based martial art whose central theme is the skill of controlling a resisting opponent in ways that force him to submit. Due to the fact that control is generally easier on the ground than in a standing position, much of the technique of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is centered round the skill of taking an opponent down to the ground and wrestling for dominant control positions from where the opponent can be rendered harmless.</p>
        <h3>What is an elo rating and how does it work?</h3>
        <p>The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in zero-sum games such as chess.</p>
        <p>A player's Elo rating is represented by a number which may change depending on the outcome of rated games played. After every game, the winning player takes points from the losing one. The difference between the ratings of the winner and loser determines the total number of points gained or lost after a game. If the high-rated player wins, then only a few rating points will be taken from the low-rated player. However, if the lower-rated player scores an upset win, many rating points will be transferred. The lower-rated player will also gain a few points from the higher rated player in the event of a draw. This means that this rating system is self-correcting. Players whose ratings are too low or too high should, in the long run, do better or worse correspondingly than the rating system predicts and thus gain or lose rating points until the ratings reflect their true playing strength.</p>
        <h3>What is the aim of this website?</h3>
        <p>This website aims to create a mathematically based rating system for the top BJJ competitors across the globe in order to create an unbiased ranking platform. Without such an elo system rankings can be effected by a wide range of factors such as bias and 'hype' which can lead to incorrect rankings.</p>
